This application was designed and created by <a href="emailto:dagoodma@ucsc.edu">David Goodman</a>
for a University of California, Santa Cruz computer science (cmps101) <a href="prog2.pdf"
target="new_page">class assignment</a>. The project has been made open source! Visit us on

This is an implementation of the
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="new_page">Game of Life</a>, which is a 
cellular automaton invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway. It was written entirely in 
Java using <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/" target="new_page">Google Web Toolkit (GWT)</a>. Although
the application is written in Java no Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run it
because GWT cross-compiles everything into JavaScript and optimizes and obfuscates it to be run
on any web server and in any browser (including Androids and iPhones).

<p class="heading">Rules for Life:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
	<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
	<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
	<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>
These rules govern the Game of Life at a fundamental level, but the most fascinating aspect of the game
are the new rules and larger patterns that emerge over the turns. In fact, this game is a universal 
computer and creatures such as gliders can be utilized to represent all of the essential logic gates needed
to build a computer. For more information read <a href="life.pdf" target="new_page">this document</a>.
